This is the post summary. The posts begin with a summary that is written just after the TOML header. A special tag ` !--more--` in angle brackets is used to mark the end of summaries.

 <!--more--> 
 -----------

 Continue writing with normal text after the summary. Do not forget to put the horizontal line by using `---`. This document is displaying the capabilities of this static site generator. Therefore, many headings are following.

## Amazing features

### Sidenotes

I'm going through such a pain for the sake of sidenotes.{{% sidenote "sn-example" %}}
This is a sidenote!
{{% /sidenote %}}Then, we continue with a new sentence.

### Marginnotes

There's also marginnotes, notes without numbers.
{{% marginnote "mn-example" %}}
This is a margin note. Let's get this a little bit longer so we can see how it performs in multiple lines.
{{% /marginnote %}}

### Tweets

Tweets are displayed when JavaScript is disabled. If JavaScript is enabled, they're displayed in a card format by executing JavaScript from Twitter.

Here's an example tweet: 

{{< tweet 1321860314661531648 >}}

Here's an example of a tweet thread: 

{{< tweet 1321833643355099138 >}}

Use the following syntax in double curly brackets for embedding tweets:

```
< tweet $tweet_id >
```

### $\LaTeX$ formulas!

Some inline math:
$e^{i \pi} = -1$ and \\(\sqrt{-1} = i \\)
and \\( a_2 = 3 \\).

And display math using escaped brackets `\\[`:
\\[
  -- \cdot_H -- \colon B(G,H) \times B(H, K)
\\]

**Supported TeX functions:**

We use KaTeX for displaying formulas. The current version included is `0.12.0`.

Note to myself: As new versions are created, update the library and this section.

Here's the supported $\LaTeX$ subset of KaTeX: https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html

Backup: https://katex.org/docs/0.12.0/support_table.html

Make sure to have the following attribute to break long URLs like these.
```css

html {
    word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

### Newthoughts
<span class="newthought">In his later books</span>, Tufte starts each
section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps.
For this we use a span with the class `newthought`, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph.

### Figures

Below, we have an example of a regular width figure:

{{< figure
  src="/images/posts/example/exports-imports.png"
  class="class param"
  title="The image title."
  caption="This is the image caption."
  label="mn-export-import"
  attr="Image attribution"
  attrlink="attribute link"
  alt="alt"
  link="link"
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

Below, is a full-width figure:

{{< figure
  src="/images/posts/example/napoleons-march.png"
  type="full"
  label="mn-napoleonic-wars"
  title="Napoleonic wars"
  caption="This is the image caption."
  attr="Image attribution"
  attrlink="attribute link"
  alt="Napoleonic wars"
  link="link"
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

And now we exhibit a margin figure:

{{< figure
  src="/images/posts/example/rhino.png"
  type="margin"
  class="class param"
  label="mn-rhino"
  title="The image title."
  label="mn-export-import"
  caption="This is the image caption."
  attr="Image attribution"
  attrlink="attribute link"
  alt="alt"
  link="link"
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

## Markdown Basics (h2)

Do not use h1 (`#`) in your texts. h1 is reserved for the titles only.

### Heading level 3

Heading level 3. Tufte recommends not to use h4 and further.

## Line breaks

You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as ‚Äútrailing whitespace‚Äù) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it‚Äôs controversial. It‚Äôs hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks.

Fortunately, there is another option supported by nearly every Markdown application: the <br> HTML tag.

## Font styles

A *cat* meow. Love **is**bold. This is really ***very***important text.	

## Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

With multiple paragraphs:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Nested:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### With Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to experiment to see which ones work.


> **The quarterly results look great!**
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

### Lists

**Ordered lists:**

1. First item
2. Second item

**Unordered Lists:**

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

**Adding Elements in Lists:**

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

Paragraphs
*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Test</title>
      </head>
    ```
    - Indented item
    - Indented item

*   And here's the third list item.

### Horizontal rule

---

Try to put a blank line before...

...and after a horizontal rule.

### Links
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

### Formatting links
I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.
See the section on [`code`](#code).

### Images

![Example](/images/posts/example/han.jpg)

**.png:**

**.svg:**
![Example](/images/posts/example/nikkei.svg)

### Escaping Characters
To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\\) in front of the character.

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

### HTML

To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file. Below is an example using em tags:

This <em>em-word</em> is italic.

### Endnotes (TODO)

Here's a simple[^bignote] footnote,[^another] and here's a longer one.[^bignote] Use sidenotes or margin notes unless you need to have a very long footnote. {{% sidenote "sn-example" %}}This is a sidenote!{{% /sidenote %}} As you can see the numberings of sidenotes and footnotes/endnotes are not designed to work together yet.

[^another]: This is a first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
